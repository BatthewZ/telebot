# Idea Evaluation Guide (Excitement-First Rubric)

## Purpose

Agents must evaluate idea files based on **inspiration, impact, and leverage first**.

Do NOT optimise for feasibility, polish, or execution details yet.

This phase answers ONLY:

> "Is this idea exciting and impactful enough to be worth pursuing at all?"

Execution difficulty is evaluated later in a separate phase.

---

# Evaluation Rules

You MUST:

1. Read the entire idea file carefully
2. Score each rubric category independently
3. Avoid optimism bias
4. Use evidence from the idea description
5. Be strict and realistic
6. Produce numeric scores only (no vibes)
7. Output results in the exact format specified below

If unsure, score LOWER not higher.

# Scoring System

Each category is scored 0–5.

Multiply by its weight.

Total max score = 100.

---

## 1. Problem Significance (weight ×3 → 15)

How painful/important is the problem?

0 = trivial  
1 = minor annoyance  
2 = productivity improvement only  
3 = meaningful pain for niche  
4 = serious pain for many  
5 = critical / costly / existential problem

Ask:

- Would someone pay today?
- Does it cost money, time, or stress?

Score × 3

---

## 2. Impact Potential (weight ×4 → 20)

How many people benefit × how deeply?

0 = tiny niche  
1 = small group  
2 = tens of thousands  
3 = hundreds of thousands  
4 = millions  
5 = industry/system-level impact

Impact is the most important factor.

Score × 4

---

## 3. Evidence & Truthiness (weight ×3 → 15)

Is this grounded in reality or speculation?

0 = pure idea / fantasy  
1 = guess  
2 = anecdotal  
3 = some research or signals  
4 = strong proof of demand  
5 = clear evidence users already hacking solutions

Look for:

- complaints
- manual workflows
- spreadsheets
- competitors
- paying customers

Score × 3

## 4. Software Leverage (weight ×3 → 15)

Does software uniquely unlock this?

0 = mostly manual  
1 = weak leverage  
2 = mixed  
3 = mostly automated  
4 = strong automation  
5 = near-zero marginal cost / platform / compounding effects

Prefer:

- automation
- APIs
- AI
- network effects
- scalability

Score × 3

---

## 5. Excitement / Energy (weight ×2 → 10)

Does this feel inspiring to build?

0 = boring  
1 = low interest  
2 = mild curiosity  
3 = enjoyable  
4 = very motivating  
5 = extremely compelling / can't ignore

Founder/agent enthusiasm matters.

Score × 2

---

## 6. Speed to First Value (weight ×2 → 10)

How fast can a small team deliver real value?

0 = >2 years  
1 = 18 months  
2 = 12 months  
3 = 6 months  
4 = 3 months  
5 = weeks

Prefer fast feedback cycles.

Score × 2

---

# Final Score Formula

Total =

(significance × 3)
(impact × 4)
(evidence × 3)
(leverage × 3)
(excitement × 2)
(speed × 2)

Max = 85

---

# Required Output Format (STRICT)

Agents MUST output exactly this structure:

significance:
impact:
evidence:
leverage:
excitement:
speed:

total:

reasoning: "a short description"

# Agent Behaviour Notes

- Be skeptical
- Avoid hype
- Prefer ideas with evidence
- Prefer software-native solutions
